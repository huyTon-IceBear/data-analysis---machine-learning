    CAST(SUBSTRING(Sector3Time, 4, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60000 +
    CAST(SUBSTRING(Sector3Time, 7, 2) AS INTEGER) * 1000 + 
    CAST(SUBSTRING(Sector3Time, 10, 3) AS INTEGER) AS Sector3Time
from 
    (
    select 
        LapNumber,
        CAST(LapTime[7:] as time) as LapTime, 
        CAST(Sector1Time[7:] as time) as Sector1Time,
        CAST(Sector2Time[7:] as time) as Sector2Time,
        CAST(Sector3Time[7:] as time) as Sector3Time
    from 
        src_laps
    where 
        filename like '%data\\20230402%' and DriverNumber = 44 and LapTime not null
    ) as lap_time_result
```

To gauge the improvement, average lap time and sector time tables were calculated for the driver's performance, serving as benchmarks to assess whether the driver's performance improved over time.

```sql avg_lap_time_result_ms
select
