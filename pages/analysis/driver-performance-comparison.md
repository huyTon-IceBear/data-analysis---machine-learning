## Improvement Comparison
5. Which driver improves best from `free practice 1` till the race?

To determine the driver who shows the most improvement from Free Practice 1 (FP1) to the race, we'll analyze two crucial factors: speed and time.
### Speed Comparison
We'll start by examining the speed data for both drivers:
```sql drivers_speed_data
SELECT 
    Date as EventDate,
    case 
        when filename like '%Practice_1%' then filename[15:instr(filename, 'Practice_1') - 2]
        when filename like '%Practice_2%' then filename[15:instr(filename, 'Practice_2') - 2]
        when filename like '%Practice_3%' then filename[15:instr(filename, 'Practice_3') - 2]
        when filename like '%Qualifying%' then filename[15:instr(filename, 'Qualifying') - 2]
        when filename like '%Race%' then filename[15:instr(filename, 'Race') - 2]
    end as EventName, 
    CASE
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_1%' THEN 'Practice_1'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_2%' THEN 'Practice_2'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_3%' THEN 'Practice_3'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Qualifying%' THEN 'Qualifying'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Race%' THEN 'Race'
    END as Session, 
    CAST(Time[7:] as time) as RaceTime, 
    Speed,
    CASE 
        WHEN DriverNumber = 44 THEN 'Hamilton'
        WHEN DriverNumber = 63 THEN 'Russell'
    END as Driver
FROM 
    src_car_data 
WHERE 
    (DriverNumber = 44 OR DriverNumber = 63) AND Speed IS NOT NULL
```
To define the trend of each racer speed, let's examine the the average speed in each session for each racer
```sql avg_speed
SELECT 
    Driver, 
    Session,
    AVG(Speed) AS avg_speed
FROM 
    ${drivers_speed_data}
WHERE 
    Session IN ('Practice_1', 'Practice_2', 'Practice_3', 'Qualifying', 'Race')
GROUP BY 
    Driver, Session
Order by
    Driver, Session
```
To visualize the trend in each driver's speed, we'll use a line chart:
<LineChart data={avg_speed} x=Session y=avg_speed series=Driver/>
The chart clearly depicts Hamilton's upward trend from Practice 1 to the Race, with minor declines from Practice 2 to Qualifying. Conversely, Russell shows a downward trend from Practice 1 to the Race, with no observable uptrend.

Conclusion:
- Hamilton demonstrates the most significant improvement during the race in terms of speed.

To provide a clearer comparison, let's analyze the difference in average speed for each driver between 'Practice_1' and 'Race'. This data highlights the variance in average speed from Free Practice 1 to the race for each driver, with the driver exhibiting the highest positive difference considered the one who improved the most:
```sql fp1_avg_speed
SELECT 
    fa.Driver, 
    (ra.race_avg_speed - fa.fp1_avg_speed) as speed_difference
FROM 
    (SELECT Driver, AVG(Speed) as fp1_avg_speed
    FROM ${drivers_speed_data}
    WHERE Session = 'Practice_1'
    GROUP BY Driver) as fa
JOIN 
    (SELECT Driver, AVG(Speed) as race_avg_speed
    FROM ${drivers_speed_data}
    WHERE Session = 'Race'
    GROUP BY Driver) as ra ON fa.Driver = ra.Driver;
```
We can further illustrate this comparison with a horizontal bar chart:
<BarChart 
    data={fp1_avg_speed}
    x=Driver
    y=speed_difference
    swapXY=true
/>
The bar chart underscores the significant disparity between Hamilton and Russell in terms of speed improvement, further confirming Hamilton's superior performance.

### Lap Time Comparison
We'll start by examining the lap time data for both drivers:
```sql drivers_lap_time_data
SELECT
    CAST(filename[7:10] || '-' || filename[11:12] || '-' || filename[13:14] as date) as EventDate,
    CASE 
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_1%' THEN filename[15:INSTR(filename, 'Practice_1') - 2]
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_2%' THEN filename[15:INSTR(filename, 'Practice_2') - 2]
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_3%' THEN filename[15:INSTR(filename, 'Practice_3') - 2]
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Qualifying%' THEN filename[15:INSTR(filename, 'Qualifying') - 2]
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Sprint%' THEN filename[15:INSTR(filename, 'Sprint') - 2]
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Race%' THEN filename[15:INSTR(filename, 'Race') - 2] 
    END AS EventName,
    CASE
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_1%' THEN 'Practice_1'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_2%' THEN 'Practice_2'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Practice_3%' THEN 'Practice_3'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Qualifying%' THEN 'Qualifying'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Sprint%' THEN 'Sprint'
        WHEN filename LIKE '%Race%' THEN 'Race'
    END AS Session,
    CAST(Time[7:] as time) as RaceTime,
    CAST(SUBSTRING(CAST(LapTime[7:] as time), 1, 2) AS INTEGER) * 3600000 + 
    CAST(SUBSTRING(CAST(LapTime[7:] as time), 4, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60000 +
    CAST(SUBSTRING(CAST(LapTime[7:] as time), 7, 2) AS INTEGER) * 1000 + 
    CAST(SUBSTRING(CAST(LapTime[7:] as time), 7, 2) AS INTEGER) AS LapTime_in_ms,
    CASE 
        WHEN DriverNumber = 44 THEN 'Hamilton'
        WHEN DriverNumber = 63 THEN 'Russell'
    END AS Driver
FROM 
    src_laps
WHERE 
    (DriverNumber = 44 OR DriverNumber = 63) AND LapTime IS NOT NULL
```

To define the trend of each racer speed, let's examine the the average lap time in each session for each racer
```sql avg_time
SELECT 
    Driver, 
    Session,
    AVG(LapTime_in_ms) AS avg_lap_time_in_ms
FROM 
    ${drivers_lap_time_data}
WHERE 
    Session IN ('Practice_1', 'Practice_2', 'Practice_3', 'Qualifying', 'Race')
GROUP BY 
    Driver, Session
Order by
    Driver, Session
```
We'll visualize the trend in each driver's lap time using a line chart:
<LineChart data={avg_time} x=Session y=avg_lap_time_in_ms series=Driver/>
The line chart reveals Hamilton's slight decline in lap time from Practice 1 to the Race, while Russell's lap time also decreases slightly over the same sessions.

Conclusion:
- Both drivers, Hamilton and Russell, demonstrate improvement in lap time from Practice 1 to the Race, with both showing a reduction in lap time over the sessions.

To further analyze the improvement, let's compare the difference in average lap time for each driver between 'Practice_1' and 'Race'. The driver with the highest negative difference signifies the most improvement:
```sql fp1_avg_lap_time
SELECT 
    fa.Driver, 
    (ra.race_avg_lap_time_in_ms - fa.fp1_avg_lap_time_in_ms) as time_difference_in_ms
FROM 
    (SELECT Driver, AVG(LapTime_in_ms) as fp1_avg_lap_time_in_ms
    FROM ${drivers_lap_time_data}
    WHERE Session = 'Practice_1'
    GROUP BY Driver) as fa
JOIN 
    (SELECT Driver, AVG(LapTime_in_ms) as race_avg_lap_time_in_ms
    FROM ${drivers_lap_time_data}
    WHERE Session = 'Race'
    GROUP BY Driver) as ra ON fa.Driver = ra.Driver;
```

We'll represent this comparison using a horizontal bar chart:
<BarChart 
    data={fp1_avg_lap_time}
    x=Driver
    y=time_difference_in_ms
    swapXY=true
/>
The bar chart indicates that both Hamilton and Russell have reduced their average lap times from Practice 1 to the Race, with Russell exhibiting a slightly greater improvement.

### Overall Conclusion
Based on the analysis, Hamilton demonstrates the most significant improvement from Free Practice 1 (FP1) to the race. Hamilton's speed showed a notable uptrend from Practice 1 to the Race, indicating substantial improvement in speed over the sessions. Furthermore, when comparing the difference in average speed between FP1 and the Race, Hamilton exhibited a significantly higher increase in speed compared to Russell.

While both Hamilton and Russell exhibited a reduction in lap time from FP1 to the Race, Hamilton's improvement in speed was more pronounced, making him the driver who improves best overall from FP1 till the race. Therefore, Hamilton emerges as the driver showing the most improvement over the course of the sessions.
